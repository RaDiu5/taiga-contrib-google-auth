In your Taiga back python virtualenv install the pip package `taiga-contrib-github-auth` with:

  GITHUB_API_CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR-GITHUB-CLIENT-SECRET"
```

#### Taiga Front

Download in your `dist/plugins/` directory of Taiga front the `taiga-contrib-github-auth` compiled code (you need subversion in your system):

```bash
  cd dist/
  mkdir -p plugins
  cd plugins
  svn export "https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-contrib-github-auth/tags/$(pip show taiga-contrib-github-auth | awk '/^Version: /{print $2}')/front/dist"  "github-auth"
```

Include in your `dist/conf.json` in the 'contribPlugins' list the value `"/plugins/github-auth/github-auth.json"`:

```json
...
    "gitHubClientId": "YOUR-GITHUB-CLIENT-ID",
    "contribPlugins": [
        (...)
        "/plugins/github-auth/github-auth.json"
    ]
...
```

```bash
npm install
```
and use:

- `gulp` to regenerate the source and watch for changes.
- `gulp build` to only regenerate the source.

Running tests
-------------

We only have backend tests, you have to add your `taiga-back` directory to the
PYTHONPATH environment variable, and run py.test, for example:

```bash
  cd back
  add2virtualenv /home/taiga/taiga-back/
  py.test
```
